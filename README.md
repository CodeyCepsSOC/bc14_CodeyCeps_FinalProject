## Our Problem statement

Living in a fast-paced society, finding the time to enjoy nature and meet new people can be challenging. We're all guilty of spending excessive time indoors, whether it's due to work, TV, video games, or excessive phone and social media use. While we understand the benefits of going for a walk, taking that first step often proves difficult. We yearn for physical activity that doesn't require joining a gym or participating in intense exercise classes. But where do we begin? Where should we go? What should we do? Our mission is to create an app that addresses these questions, helping people get outdoors and connect with others through nature.

## Our Mission
We strive to inspire more individuals to venture outside and enjoy nature, improving their physical and mental well-being. Studies show that going on short daily walks and having a supportive community can have a significant positive impact on health. Our app, WalkMate, aims to reintroduce people from all walks of life to the joys of the outdoors, enabling them to connect with fellow walkers in their communities. We want to make the process of going for a walk accessible to everyone.



## Introducing WalkMate
WalkMate is a mobile app designed to help users find exciting walking routes in their local area, join a vibrant community of walkers, and participate in events tailored to diverse interests. While there are existing apps for specific sports activities such as hiking, biking, and intense workouts catering to fitness enthusiasts, we wanted to create an app that includes everyone. WalkMate goes beyond focusing solely on the physical aspects of walking; it also emphasises the social aspect. Users can explore scenic walking routes based on their location and have the opportunity to meet new people by creating an account and signing up to events.

## Our Workflow
To ensure effective planning and organisation, we utilised Trello, implementing the Kanban framework to manage our tasks efficiently. Daily stand-ups allowed us to discuss progress and address any obstacles we encountered. Retrospectives provided an opportunity to reflect on what went well and identify areas for improvement. We embraced pair programming, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members. Slack served as our primary communication and resource-sharing platform. Figma and Figjam facilitated our design process, enabling us to create wireframes and visually appealing, intuitive designs. We relied on Google Drive for documentation purposes.

## Our Design process
 After conducting thorough research, we carefully selected a colour palette that evokes the essence of nature. Incorporating shades of green, yellow, beige, and sky blue, our chosen colours radiate calmness, serenity, and peacefulness. We aimed to create a clean, accessible, and visually engaging design, ensuring ease of navigation. We also checked the colour contrast of the palette chosen to ensure it met web accessibility requirements. Inspired by nature, we designed a nature-themed logo, leveraging its shapes as distinctive emblems within our app.

## Research
Research

We dedicated a significant portion of our time in carrying out consumer/competitor research. First we conducted questionnaires to hand out to the wider cohort to see if there was an interest for our initial idea. Then we collated the feedback and further discussed which features would be a priority for us to implement.
We did accessibility research to make sure our app would be widely accessible to everyone as a key theme for our app is inclusivity. We looked at competitor websites and looked at what makes their UI/UX successful so we could also incorporate similar features and design.
