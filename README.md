## Our Problem statement
Living in a busy fast-paced society, it can be difficult to find the time to get outdoors and meet new people. We are all guilty of spending too much time indoors, whether it be working from home, watching TV, playing video games or spending too much time on our phones and social media. We are all aware of the benefits of getting outdoors and going for a walk but we often find it difficult to get started. We all want to do some sort of physcial activity without having the mental and financial pressure of joining a gym or doing intensive exercise classes. But how do we get started? Where do we go? What do we do? We want to create an app that will help people get outdoors and enjoy nature.

## Our Mission

We want to encourage more people to venture outside to improve their physical and mental well-being. Going on short daily walks and having a community around you has been shown to have a positive impact on your health.

Our app aims to get people from all walks of life back outdoors enjoying all that nature has to offer and to help them connect with others in their community. We want to make the process of going for a walk accessible to everyone.

## Our App

Our app is called WalkMate and it is a mobile app that allows users to find walk routes in their local area, join a community of walkers and sign up to events that cater to a wide range of interests. There are apps out there that offer a wide range of sports-related activities such as hiking, bike-riding and intensive sports catered to fitness enthusiasts. We intended to create an app that was inclusive of everyone. Whether they have a busy lifestyle or find it difficult to get out and about, our app is designed to help them get started. Our app is unique in the sense that it does not just focus on the physical aspect of walking but also the social aspect. Our app allows users to search for walking routes based on location with the option to meet new people if they sign up for events.

## Our workflow

For planning and organisation, we used trello and implemented the kanban framework to help us keep track of our tasks. We had daily stand-ups to discuss our progress and any blockers we were facing. We also had daily retrospectives to discuss what went well and what we could improve on. We used pair programming to collaboratively solve problems and to help us learn from each other.   We used Slack as our main form of communication and sharing resources. We used Figma and Figjam to help us with our design process which included our wireframes. We used Google Drive to help us with our documentation.
