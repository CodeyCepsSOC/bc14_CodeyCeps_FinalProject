## Our Team

We are a team of 6 developers who are passionate about the outdoors and the positive impact it can have on your mental and physical health. We are all graduates of the School of Code Full Stack Software Development course and this is our final project.

## Our Mission

"We want to encourage more people to venture outside to improve their physical and mental well-being. Going on short daily walks and having a community around you has been shown to have a positive impact on your health" Our app aims to get people from all walks of life back outdoors enjoying all that nature has to offer and to help them connect with others in their community. We want to make the process of going for a walk accessible to everyone.

## Our App

Our app is called WalkMate and it is a mobile app that allows users to find walk routes in their local area, join a community of walkers and sign up to events that cater to a wide range of interests. There are apps out there that offer a wide range of sports-related activities such as hiking, bike-riding and more extreme sports tailored for sporty individuals. We intended to create an app that was inclusive of everyone. Whether they have a busy lifestyle or find it difficult to get out and about, our app is designed to help them get started. Our app is unique in the sense that it does not just focus on the physical aspect of walking but also the social aspect. Our app allows users to venture out for leisurely strolls and meet new people in their local area.
