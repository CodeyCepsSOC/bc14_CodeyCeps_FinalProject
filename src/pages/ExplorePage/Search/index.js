/* 
Created a form element - within this it contains a label (for accessbility, this does not display due to css display none
but the aria-hidden="false" means it will still get read by screenreader), input field (this contains an onChange function that
tracks what is written in the input field) and a button (which at some point will have a function attached to it for searching).
The useState is used in the onChange function to store the state of what is typed.
